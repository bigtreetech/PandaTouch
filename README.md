# Cloud mode access code (2024/11/04)
Note that Bambu have recently implemented a 2FA cloud mode access code process even if the user has 2FA disabled. We have a firmware update that will be relesed in the next few days to allow users to input the code directly to the Panda Touch. Please bear with us while we test it.
